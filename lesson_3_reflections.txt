When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When you are working collaboratively and need to share files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may want to choose when and how to make additions to your remote repository.
